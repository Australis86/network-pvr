# Network PVR Scripts
This is a collection of scripts for a network-accessible PVR running TVHeadEnd. It was designed and tested on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian, but it should be straightforward to modify for other Unix-based systems running TVHeadEnd as well.

## Dependencies

The scripts are build on Python 2.7.x (though may work down to 2.5.x).

## Usage

Details coming soon.
